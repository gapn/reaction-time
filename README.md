# Reaction Time ⚛️ 🧪

A molecule building game built for the FCC 'Brain' Game Jam.

## 📖 About the Game

**Reaction Time** is a game, created for a game jam with the theme "Teach Me Something". The goal is to build as many molecules from the given atoms as you can in the limited time you get. For each successful 'reaction' you get extra time, effectively creating perpetual game if you want.

But be careful, if you choose the wrong atoms, it can be a catastrophic event. Are you ready for your alchemistic trial?

## 🕹️ How to Play

* Your objective is to build as many molecules as you can.
* You start with **2 minutes** on the clock and **earn more time** with each correct combination.
* The game ends when the **timer runs out** or when you make a **catastrophic mistake** of chosing the wrong atoms for your molecule.
